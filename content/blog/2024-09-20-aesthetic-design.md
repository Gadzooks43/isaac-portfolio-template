# Aesthetic Design Reading:

“Whitespace is to GUI’s as the O’line is to a football team's offense.”

The offensive line has the most underappreciated positions in football by the viewers. They don’t make catches, tackles, or even touch the ball after the center snaps it, yet a strong offensive line can make a 3rd string quarterback look like Tom Brady and a backup running back like Adrian Peterson. Similarly important to a GUI is the use of whitespace. Its effects are not directly noticed by the user but the only reason the user gets to look at the website and say “wow this looks so pretty” is because proper spacing and utilization of whitespace was used to create order for the components. Linemen block in certain directions to create gaps in the defense for a running back to capitalize on, and similarly whitespace helps our eyes move smoothly through the interface, helping us interpret things one piece at a time. This concept is important for my career because as I create GUI’s I need to remember to not just cram together my functionality, but to utilize the whole page to neatly display my content and use whitespace as a funnel or container for my components.
