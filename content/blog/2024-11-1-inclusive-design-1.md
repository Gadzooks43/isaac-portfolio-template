# Inclusive Design 1 Reading:

Word: Complicated

    The word that stuck out to me in this reading specifically was complicated. This is becuase even with validators and tools it really takes a personal touch to make a website accessible. Following functional requirements will only get you so far, so you need to go in and user test and address the issues. This can be difficult becuase the person you are design the accessibility for isn't you. Its a group of people that could be very narrow or very, very broad. In my career I can remember to be aware of the time and detailed attention it takes to make my sites accessible.
