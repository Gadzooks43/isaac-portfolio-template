# Debreifing from User Tests Reading:

Word: Early

In the reading, one of the tips talked about that fact that you testing one user early is better than testing 50 at the end of the project. This is becuase it is so much easier to make changes early on and especially when a GUI is not in production. As the project gets more complex not only can changes create more issues but they can take longer to implement too. In my career I will remember to do consistent user testing when I do projects.
