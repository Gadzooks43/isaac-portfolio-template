# Design Systems Reading:

So I just got done reading Nathan Curtis's article "Space, Grids, and Layouts in Design Systems," and the word that really sums it up for me is "foundation." I picked this word because he talks so much about how space, grids, and layouts are the basic building blocks of any design system, and without them, everything else kind of falls apart, it's like trying to build a house without a solid base, which obviously isn't going to work.

I think I learned a lot from this, especially about the importance of getting the basics right. By understanding spacing and grid layouts, I can create designs that not only look good but also work well, which is super important. It means I can build interfaces that provide consistent experiences across different platforms and devices, which is huge these days. So from this, I realized that focusing on the foundation will help me collaborate better with others, make the design process smoother, and in the end, create products that are intuitive and accessible.
