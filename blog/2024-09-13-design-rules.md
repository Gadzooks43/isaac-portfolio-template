# design Rules Reading:

This week I read chapters 2-5 of "Don't Make Me Think" by Steve Krug, and if I had to pick one word to sum up what really stuck with me, it’s gotta be “Clarity.” Krug talks about how people don’t actually read websites, they just scan them quick, looking for the first thing that catches their eye, and they don’t choose the best option, they just pick whatever looks good enough and they don’t really try to figure out how stuff works they just muddle through and hope it does.

This idea totally hit home for me because it made me realize how much more important it is to make things clear and simple than to make them flashy or complex, like if a web page is confusing or makes people think too much they’re just gonna leave, they won’t even bother trying to figure it out. Krug’s idea that a web page should be like a billboard you’re passing at 60 mph really nails it, it’s gotta be so obvious what you’re supposed to do that you don’t have to stop and think.

Now, thinking about clarity like this changed how I see design and usability, I used to think that adding more features and making things look cool was what mattered most, but now I see none of that means anything if people can’t understand what they’re looking at or what they’re supposed to do, clarity is what makes or breaks a product and if it’s not clear, it’s not gonna work, people will just go somewhere else.
