# Portfolios and Design Narratives Reading:

Word Choice: "Sticky"

The word sticky identifies what the reading What Makes Messages Stick? says. It is all about writing messages that stick in the person's minds and remember them. Chip and Dan Heath said, Sticky ideas have six sets of principles: simple, unexpected, concrete, credible, emotional, and story, which form the abbreviation success.

The word relates to more than just memorability. It says that the message sticks in peoples minds and induces action. The reading points out the frequent curse called the Curse of Knowledge where experts communicate abstractions, understandable to them yet not to others. If we make messages sticky this barrier can be overcome so that our ideas will not only be understood but remembered and impactful.
