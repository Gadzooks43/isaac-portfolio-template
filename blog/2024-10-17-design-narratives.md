# Portfolios and Design Narratives Reading:

Word Choice: "Narrative"

I have used the word "narrative" because the blog mentions how storytelling plays an imperative role in UX portfolios. It is not just about showing your designs, but taking the person who is viewing them through the thought process, challenges, and solutions. This is a very important concept to remember as a developer to be able to communicate clearly and concisely the value of the work.

The trends of telling your work as a cohesive story have gone a long way in demonstrating problem-solving abilities and meaningfully engaging stakeholders in my future career.
