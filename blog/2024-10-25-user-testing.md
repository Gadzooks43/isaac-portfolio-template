# User Testing 101 Reading:

Word: Average

The reading talks about an issue with user testing. What is the average user like? How how can we use that to test? Unfortunately, this is a hole for developers to fall in. It leads to a bias in testing and is just generally bad practice. It's best to assume that users are all unique and idiosyncratic. In my career I can use this knowledge to test broadly with users and to not design purely on my assumptions of my user pool.
