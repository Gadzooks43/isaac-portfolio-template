# Inclusive Design 2 Reading:

Word: Constraints

    I chose the word constraints for this reading. Constraints are important becuase they lead us in the right direction to use an object or system that we have never used before. They tell us what the thing is meant to do and what it's not meant to do. In the reading the author goes on too describe how there are even different categories for constraints; physical, cultural, semantic, and logical. In my career I need to make sure that I don't just design function but that my design limits the system to lead the user toward the function and away from unintended use routes or cases.
