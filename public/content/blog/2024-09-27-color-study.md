# Color Study Blog:

The screen I chose was the antimalware software for my computer. The colors I see in this screen are Green, Orange, and Navy Blue. The closest thing I can find it matching is a Tweaked Triad, but you need to assume the navy is on the blue-violet part, not the blue part. This seems to convey a simple, safe and secure mood. I think this is the approach that the developers had in mind. It makes sense to make your anti malware software try and convey something safe and secure. It also has a minimal feel to it since the majority of the screen is the navy color with only very little green on the status and the orange in the logo. I think that this is also what the developers intended as Avast advertises itself as a simple cheaper option to the more standard in your face anti malware services.

I think out of the ones that I created, the last one with violet, blue-violet, and blue-green was the most effective. But the original color scheme I think gets the point across the best. I think that the one I created is more effective than the other two because the other two use a lot of unsafe warm colors for larger parts of the screen. The warmer colors convey warning and a need for attention while the navy and green are safe and calm which is better for this app. I am defining the most effective one by the one that achieves what the developers attempted to achieve in their version of the app.
