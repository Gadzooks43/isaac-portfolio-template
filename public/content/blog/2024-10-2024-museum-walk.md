# Museum Walk: Pie Case:

![photo](content/blog/pie-case.png)

The art piece that I was inspired by is called "Pie Case". It is a painting from 1975 by Ralph Goings. Starting in the 1960s artists like Goings started painting very realistic and literal scenes of the ordinary things in the life of someone in their time. "Pie Case" is one of his most popular, it depicts a very standard bakery scene with donuts, pies, and a soda machine. Goings would start with his projects by taken many photos of things throughout his day and then decide on a project to start. One work could often take him a month to do as they were so realistic and took so long to paint every little detail.

Rule of Thirds:

The painting seems to be neetly seperated into a 3X3 column. The rows are very clear, the top being mostly blank, the bottom being mostly clear other than the donuts and some strange metal things that I don't exactly know how to identify. But the middle row is where the main focus is it has the bright and colorfull case full of pie that catch your eyes immediatly. In the columns it also seems to be sectioned well the first colum has the one set of pies; the second section has another set of pies; and the third section has the soda machine and another metal thing. So your eyes are mostly attracted to the center of the painting.

Direction of the Eyes:

My eyes were drawn to the very center of the painting where the pies are. I believe this is due to the very realistic lighting that is painted onto the scene, it makes the pies glisten and stick out, complimenting their goldren crusts. If by any chance this section is actually about people eyes in the painting, there are no people in the painting. Just wanted to add that. My eyes are not drawn toward the outsides as they are either bare or the are shaded darker, like the soda machine in the top right.

Color Balance:

The color in the painting is very complex with it's shading. This is because it is painted to be very realistic so the number of different colors is large. But if you take out shading and focus on the main colors it is mostly a mix of light greens reds and browns. Browns being the table and pies and donuts and greens being the trays, a machine and the walls. So the pallete manages to stay confined in that sense. This seems to be able to be boiled down to Blue-Green, Red and Orange which I believe has harmony in the Split-Complimentary way. The use of lighting in the photo is the most interesting part. It lets the artist choose the focus of the painting just by adding light and shading. The painting could have been called "Donut Tray" if he had lit up the donuts and moved the image down 1/3.

UI:

My UI is a morning donut shop. Here every morning you can get a randomized set of three donuts that are available at the local shop. Then you can either keep those three donuts or spin for new ones. Once you have three donuts you are satisfied with you can go and checkout and head out to the donut shop to get your donuts and coffee. The peices of inspiration I am drawing are realistic donut icons, which match the realistic and breakfast dessert theme of the painting, the 3x3 column aspect that keeps the attention at the center and has minimal stuff around the edges, and finally I added some lighting and shading to the donuts so that they pop out and your eyes move to them similar to how the pies in the case are litten up.


In this project I learned the importance of spacing and lighting in grabbing and focussing the attention of the audience/user. I learned how even with a large color pallete you can focus on a few main general colors to keep a color focus.
