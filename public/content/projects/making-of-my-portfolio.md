# Making of my Portfolio:

- Clean, intuitive navigation
    - I did add link navigation into the page to make sure old links I had submitted and new assignments could be found. That being said, most of the navigation is entirely contained within the main page. The three Cards can be activated and in them are two navigation devices, a sidebar that lists posts, and a tags header for filtering. This combination should make it simple enough to find posts quickly.
- intentional color choices
    - I chose greyscale for my palette. This was due to my UIUN project and my final project. My final project is in greyscale and I thought it would make sense to keep with the theme. Since I am a software engineer at the end of the day I think the palette reflects what I would want to put out to potential employer.
- harmony between affordances and signifiers
    - The cards can be clicked and activated to expand into a content display. The cards light up when hovered over and your mouse turns into the press symbol to indicate they are clickable. 
- some consideration to accessibility
    - You will notice the lower contrast in my color palette. While it is fair to say that most people would benefit from a high contrast palette, the group that I chose for the UIUN project was photosensitive people and they usually need a lower contrast palette with less irritating colors like red and blue. For this reason I decided to go with a theme that reflected that research I had done as well as a mix of inspiration from the final project I did.
- usability elements to help make content easier to digest
    - I created a sidebar on the active 'Card' that has a good scrollbar to make it easier to use. I also added tag buttons to navigate the content more easily.
- evidence of evolution
    - Initially I had the idea that it would be cool if all my markdowns laoded from popup 'Cards' on the screen. But since docusaurus loads markdowns through its routing this was very difficult to do on it. So I replaced the docusaurus app with a simple react app and implemented it. I also had to then figure out what to do with the front matter on the markdown files that had the slugs, title, and tags. I extracted the data prebuild and cut it out of the posts so the front matter didn't get in the way. Then I created tag buttons to filter posts for better navigation. 
- proper attribution of others' work
    - Below images I found are attributions to their creators. Also all image were either my own, created by Chat GPT, or retrieved from a royalty free image site.
- intentional integration of your values
    - My values are simplicity and efficiency. This can be found in my portfolio in the greyscale color scheme and the simple main page that keeps all my posts neatly contained inside the three 'Card' containers (about me, projects, blog).
